# Online Shopping Platform

An online shopping platform is software designed to enable users to purchase goods and services over the internet. Users can access the platform through a website or mobile application, where they can search and compare products from different vendors, add products to their shopping carts, and make secure payments. Sellers can also use the platform to create and manage their online store, manage their inventory, and process orders and payments. The software can also include shipment tracking, returns management and reporting on sales and store performance.
